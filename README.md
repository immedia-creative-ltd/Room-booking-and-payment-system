Room booking and payment system

This code is for a booking form that allows the user to book rooms, specify occupancy and select experiences. The code tracks selections and calculates the final price. Users can add to and edit their selections, with prices being updated in real time.

This code was added to the WordPress plugin ZigaForm dashboard here: 'Global settings' > 'Additional'.

There is a screenshot in the repository.
